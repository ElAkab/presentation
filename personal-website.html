					<h2>Who am i ?</h2>
					<p>
						A young person who had to interrupt their studies for health
						reasons. This forced me to rethink my future and to find a field
						truly within my reach. For a long time, computer science meant
						nothing to me â€” I only saw it as a world too complex and far from my
						abilities. Yet, after searching and exploring, I eventually dove
						into it and discovered a completely new universe, both stimulating
						and demanding. Step by step, I learned how to write code, to turn
						mistakes into progress, and to hold on despite my doubts. Even
						today, I still see myself as a beginner who experiments, often
						fails, but enjoys moving forward in a field that never spoke to me
						until now. Each project, no matter how small, feels like a victory
						in my journey, a way to prove that I can grow. The path is still
						full of obstacles, but it pushes me to go further each day and gives
						me the feeling that Iâ€™ve finally found a ground where I can build
						something meaningful. It may not be a perfect story, but it is mine,
						and with this background I continue to move forward.

							This project was designed to help memorize common HTTP/HTTPS

						<p>
							On the left side, buttons are available for each status code. Once

							right side, the corresponding explanation appears, with an option
